An Android application that allows the user to easily manage character information for D&amp;D 5th Edition.
This app was created during the Fall 2016 semester as our semester project for Software Engineering II.

### Introduction
Our project will be based around collating information about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, and then making an Android app to present this information to the user in a convenient format so that they have the information easily available on their phone. 

The app will include a “character sheet” of sorts that will allow the user to view and edit their character statistics, and will have tools such as an equipment list, so that the user can keep track of their equipment, and even sell it. We will also implement a “spellbook” so that users can keep track of what spells they have prepared, and which spells they know. And finally, a skills tool to let the player roll skill checks. One feature we had originally planned, but have scrapped, was a status tracker to keep track of important information during combat.
